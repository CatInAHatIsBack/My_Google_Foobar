# Types of binary trees
    - Full binary tree
        - All exept leaf nodes have 2 children
    - Complete binary tree
        - All levels are completely filled exept last
        - All keys as left as possible
    - Perfect binary tree
        - All nodes are full
        - Leaf nodes are same lvl
        - Num of leaf nodes is num of internal nodes + 1
    - Balanced binary tree
        - Height is O(log n) : n num of nodes
        - Height of left and right subtrees of nodes differ in height by no more than 1
    - Degenerate tree
        - Nodes have one child each.
        - Basically a linked list
