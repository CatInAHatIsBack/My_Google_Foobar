# Backtracking
- algorithmic technque for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point of time (by time, here, is referred to the time elapsed till reaching any level of the search tree). 

### There are three types of problems in backtracking â€“  
- In this, we search for a feasible solution.
- In this, we search for the best solution.

# My Takeaway
- algo for incr building solution
- recursion to explore all the possibilities until we get the best result
- Decision Problem
- Optimization Problem
- Enumeration Problem
